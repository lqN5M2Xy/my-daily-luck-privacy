No sensitive or personal content is included in these notifications.

## No third-party services
This app **does not use**:
- Advertising services  
- Analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase)  
- Cloud storage

## Security Measures – Google Play Integrity API

“My Daily Luck” utilizes the Google Play Integrity API to verify the authenticity and integrity of the app installation. This API generates a security token that confirms the app is running in an unaltered, genuine environment. No personal user data is collected, processed, or shared with third parties as part of this verification process. The information obtained is used solely for internal security purposes—to help prevent tampering and unauthorized access to the app.

## User rights
Since no personal data is collected or processed, no actions like data access or deletion are required.  
The app is fully anonymous.

## Future Updates
Any future updates to the app that involve additional data collection or changes in data processing will be promptly reflected in this privacy policy. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically for any changes.
