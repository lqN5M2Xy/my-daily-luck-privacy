## What data is collected?
The app stores the following information **locally on the device only**:

No sensitive or personal content is included in these notifications.

## No third-party services
This app **does not use**:
- Advertising services  
- Analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase)  
- Cloud storage  
- Social media integrations

## User rights

The app is fully anonymous.
