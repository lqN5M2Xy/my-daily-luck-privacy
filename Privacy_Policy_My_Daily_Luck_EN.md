# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** April 19, 2025

This privacy policy explains how the Android app **“My Daily Luck”** handles user data.

## Responsible Entity
Lokman Kerey  
(Independent developer of this app)  
Contact: aldrikkere@gmail.com

## What data is collected?
The app stores the following information locally on the device only:

- Last Check Timestamp: The time of the last daily check.
- Next Check Timestamp: The time when the next check becomes available.
- User Input: The last number entered by the user.
- Random Number: The randomly generated number used for the luck calculation.
- Luck Score: The result of the luck check (e.g., “Good Luck”, “Average Luck”, “Bad Luck”).
- Emoji: A visual indicator (emoji) associated with your luck.
- Recommendation: A message providing advice based on the luck result.

These data points are used solely to manage app functionality (e.g., controlling the daily check interval, sending notifications, and displaying personalized results) and to enhance the user experience.
No personal data is collected, processed, or transmitted to any server or third party.

## Notifications
The app uses the Android `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission to send **one daily notification** reminding the user that the next luck check is available.  
No sensitive or personal content is included in these notifications.

## No third-party services
This app **does not use**:
- Advertising services  
- Analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase)  
- Cloud storage  
- Social media integrations

## Security Measures – Google Play Integrity API and Internet Usage
“My Daily Luck” utilizes the Google Play Integrity API to verify the authenticity and integrity of the app installation.  
To perform this check, the app requires the Android `INTERNET` permission, but **only** to communicate with Google Play’s Integrity servers. **No personal or other user data** is ever transmitted, collected, or stored on any remote server. All integrity verification tokens are used exclusively for internal security purposes—preventing tampering and ensuring the app runs in a genuine, unaltered environment.

## User rights
Since no personal data is collected or processed, no actions like data access or deletion are required.  
The app is fully anonymous.

## Future Updates
Any future updates to the app that involve additional data collection or changes in data processing will be promptly reflected in this privacy policy. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically for any changes.
